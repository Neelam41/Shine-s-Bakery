        <h3>Go Heavy or Go Home</h3> 
        <p>
            Going to the gym every day can help improve your 
            cardiovascular system, strengthen your muscles, help you maintain 
            your weight, boost your mental health and decrease the odds that you'll develop other health 
            conditions. Exercising daily strengthens your heart and allows it to pump more efficiently with less strain.</p>

                                <p>After our introduction session, I will design a workout program specifically for your goals and needs based on how many workouts your schedule allows.

                                    I also offer online coaching for those on a budget or who have experience in the gym and do not need to be coached in-person.
